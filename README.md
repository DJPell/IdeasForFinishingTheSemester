-I would much prefer class be made asynchronous as I would like to work more during the day
now that we have more free time. Trying to open a window 10:15-1 would make trying to work an
8-5 job very tedious. To replace the class schedule, jupyter notebooks could be made specifically
for lecture (similarly to how they have been, but with more explaination in markdown cells) and a
discussion program such as Slack could be used to keep active communication.
